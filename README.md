# Education-Quiz-App
This is the final project of Selorm Tito Ayikoe in the Google Udacity Africa Scholarship Challenge. 

It is an educationall quiz app called ICT Shortcuts Quiz app and it is designed to help students memorise keyboard shortcuts

The app was made with a LinearLayout, TextViews, EditViews, Checkboxers, Radio buttions etc. 

There is a submit button after completion of the quiz and a reset button which clears out all answered fields and thus prepares the app for new entries.

The .apk file for the quiz app can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ExPfwriR5d1PMFaLX9XnRhzdftiRsrbE?usp=sharing
